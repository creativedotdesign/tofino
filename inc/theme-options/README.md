# Theme Options

The Theme Options use the [WordPress Theme Customization API](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API) and [Customizer API](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/advanced-topics/customizer-api/).

## Admin Logo

Upload a custom admin logo to be displayed on the login screen.

This logo is also used in the email templates for branding.

You might need to add some additional css to tweak the logo size / position. Add your CSS in to the file ``assets/styles/base/wp-admin.scss``.
