## Contributing

Updates and pull requests should be done on the dev branch.

New features should be done in a separate branch and sent as a pull request.

Nothing should be merged into the master branch until it has been tested on dev and (preferably) approved by all devs.

The dev branch is automatically deployed to http://tofino.lambdacreatives.com so you can test there.

No breaking changes except at major versions.
